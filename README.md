- 👋 Hi, I’m Malcolm aka Mally. I live in beautiful Cape Town, South Africa.

- 👀 I’m interested in assisting SME's and individuals who need programming skills to solve data issues and problematic processes in their lives. 
In particular those that require data capture, retrieval and analytics.

- 🌱 I’m currently improving my Python skills, already having a strong background in IT Management and the SDLC using VB.NET, C#, SQL

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cloud initiative as future tech and processes will involve cloud technology
